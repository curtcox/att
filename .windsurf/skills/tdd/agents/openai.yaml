  default_prompt: |
    Use strict TDD (red → green → refactor). Work in vertical slices:
    - Write ONE failing test for ONE behavior (verify it fails for the right reason).
    - Implement the minimum code to pass.
    - Refactor only when tests are green.
    Prefer integration-style tests through public interfaces; avoid mocking internals unless needed at boundaries.
