# Repository Agent Instructions

## Startup
1. Read `todo/NEXT_MACHINE_HANDOFF.md` before making changes.
2. Follow the "Active Next Slice" and "Resume Checklist" sections in that file.
3. Update both `todo/NEXT_MACHINE_HANDOFF.md` and `todo/master_plan.md` as progress is made.

## Continuity Rule
- If the user says "Continue", resume from `todo/NEXT_MACHINE_HANDOFF.md` without re-planning from scratch.
